# Square Root Calculator
This program written in C calculates the *square root* of a positive floating-point number using ***Newton's Method***.
- **</h1>Newton's Method</h1>** - Newton's method, also known as Newton-Raphson method, is a powerful technique for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It can be applied to find the square root of a number ***S***  by solving the equation ***x^2 - S = 0.***
